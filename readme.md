Web Project 1 - Learning how to Learn landing page

This was the first project for our web development bootcamp.  We used our new knowledge in html and css to build a professional landing page.  We used flexbox, animations, and BEM methedology to bring it all together.

Future plans for this project include making the site more mobile friendly.  As of right now, it looks best on a desktop and needs a mobile make over with the header images and other parts of the project.
